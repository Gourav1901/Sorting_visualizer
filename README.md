Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Whether you're a student learning algorithms or a developer looking to brush up on your skills, this tool provides an engaging and intuitive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work. It demonstrates the process of sorting in real time, providing visual feedback on how elements are moved, swapped, and compared during the sorting process.

Features
-Multiple Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports various popular sorting algorithms such as:
```
-Bubble Sort
-Selection Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Merge Sort
-Quick Sort
-Heap Sort
-And more!
```
-Real-time Visualization: See how each sorting algorithm works step by step with animations that highlight element comparisons, swaps, and movements.

-Adjustable Speed: Control the speed of the sorting visualization by adjusting the slider, from slow motion to fast execution.

-Customizable Array Size: Users can customize the number of elements to sort, generating arrays of different sizes.

-Random and Predefined Arrays: Generate a random array or choose predefined ones for consistent comparison across sorting algorithms.

-Pause and Restart: Pause the visualization at any point to analyze the algorithm's steps and restart whenever needed.

Getting Started
